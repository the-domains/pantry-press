Julie Gibb and Christian Morrison started working together in 1990, originally designing books for artists, museums and galleries as GreenStreet Design. They purchased and installed their first letterpress, a Vandercook SP-15, in the pantry of their Toronto home in 1994\. Three years later they moved the press and more equipment, previously in storage, to a pre-war storefront in Toronto's west end. For ten years there, they printed wedding invitations, greeting cards, posters, business and personal stationery and more. 2007 saw the purchase of a new home for Morrison and Gibb as well as for Pantry Press, which now occupies the former stables behind their home. Pantry Press continues to design and print projects for its clients. Pantry Press Editions was born in the Summer of 2009 with the publishing of "Sourdough A Recipe For Life" by well-known baker Erin Turcke. Pantry Press Editions is an extension of our interest in book design, food and travel. We will release and distribute more titles focussing on design, food and travel soon.
